This is a .NET Core API for an application I am developing.  It provides CRUD access for the app to access it's database.
It is still a work in progress and does not have authentication or other security features as it is accessing only a skeletal
database structure.   As the application progresses, it will eventually use JWT-based authentication to ensure that it only handles requests from valid
app sessions.
